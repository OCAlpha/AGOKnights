    Okay guys, here's how this file works.
    You do all your normal HTML page design, but before anything will display
    you have to put an HTML comment in the page that says 
    "Effective From: <date> To: <date>"
    where <date> is in a MM/DD/YYYY time format, no spaces.
    Both dates are inclusive, so if you want to start seeing the page on October 1st and end on October 31st,
    the comment would read "Effective From: 10/01/2014 To: 10/31/2014".  
    Then the parser will display everything below that for the month of October,
    OR UNTIL YOU PUT A NEW EFFECTIVE DATE RANGE.
    
    Yes, you can build the page with lots of different date ranges, even overlapping date ranges.
    The parser will read everything below a date range as effective that range until you put a new date range in.
    These comments will not appear on the client side, ever, because it is before the first effective date range comment.
    Likewise, you can put whatever you want before the first effective date range comment and it will NEVER show up on the site.
    This is all in an HTML comment to make Visual Studio happy, not because it actually needs to be for the parser to work...
