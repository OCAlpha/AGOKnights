            <p>Alpha is a group of Christian brothers whose ultimate goal is to imitate the servant leadership of our savior, Jesus Christ. Below are a few details about us from our constitution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our name, Alpha Gamma Omega, comes from the Greek word "ago", which means "I lead, I bring, I go."</li>
                <li>Our mottos are Psalms 133:1 "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity!" (RSV) and 2nd Timothy 1:7 "For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline."</li>
                <li>Our four official colors are Black, Silver, White, and Red.</li>
                <li>Our mascot is the medieval Knight.</li>
                <li>
                    The purpose of Alpha Gamma Omega is to instill in her members:
                    <ol>
                        <li>An Obligation to God - We are composed of dedicated men that bring each other closer to God through Christ and grow with each other in fellowship.</li>
                        <li>An Obligation to Club Spirit and Brotherhood - We strive to give her members a sense of duty and obligation to the club's activities and to have incredibly strong, fierce sense of spirit to the club.</li>
                        <li>An Obligation to Excellence - We strive not to obtain trophies, rather for excellence in all we do.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our sponsors are:
                <ul>
                    @{
                        foreach (string sponsor in sponsors)
                        {
                            <li>@sponsor</li>
                        }
                    }
                </ul>
            </p>
